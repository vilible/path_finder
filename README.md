# üîç WayFinder

*A new way to find your way*

## ü§î What is this app for?

The purpose of Way Finder is to use its full potential in finding a path from point A to point B using the points it generates. The path finding algorithm prioritizes to keep the length between points as short as possible, so the path may not be the shortest, but the shapes created can be amazing.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run?
